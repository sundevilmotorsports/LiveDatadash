# Tauri + React + Typescript

This template should help get you started developing with Tauri, React and Typescript in Vite.

# Web testing
1. Open http://localhost:1420/ in browser (optional)
2. Navigate to ./live-datadash in terminal
3. Run 'npm run tarui dev'

# Goodies
- Use .svg for images, node.js dislikes other file types for optimization reasons
- To change tab image the file favicon.ico must be changed (I cannot find where it is called in the code)

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
